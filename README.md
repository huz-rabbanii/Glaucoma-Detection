# Glaucoma-Detection
This repository implements a U-Net based model for segmenting the optic disc and cup from retinal fundus imagesâ€”a critical step in automated glaucoma detection. By leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks, this project aims to provide accurate biomedical image segmentation, enabling earlier diagnosis of glaucoma.
